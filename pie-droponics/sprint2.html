          <h2>Sprint II</h2>
        </header>
        <h3><b>Sprint Overview</b></h3>
        <p>The goal of sprint II was to improve upon sprint 1 by</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Housing all components on a cart</li>
          <li>Build modular plant channels</li>
          <li>Fully automated light & pump actuation</li>
          <li>Making it aesthetically pleasing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Mechanical Updates</b></h3>
        <p>
          For the second stage of our project, we moved our system onto a cart
          and expanded our system to include 3 channels to accommodate a total
          of 9 plants. With more sophisticated materials, we were tasked with
          preparing the materials with proper cuts, hole sizes, and sealants to
          assemble our modular design.
        </p>
        <p>
          A big challenge for Sprint II was purchasing the correct materials for
          our design. It was a learning experience to modify our mechanical
          design based on the availability of materials at Home Depot,
          specifically the hose barbs (downspouts). To conserve our funds for
          materials, we decided not to purchase end caps for the gutter
          channels. We 3D-printed our end caps with PLA, but one of these prints
          had a leakage due to a larger layer height compared to the successful,
          watertight PLA end caps. We also replaced our
          trash-can-water-reservoir with an opaque plastic tote bin that would
          easily fit in the bottom of our cart, and could be sealed with a lid.
          This would prevent the growth of algae in our water, and also stop any
          spilling with movement of the cart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than using a small peristaltic pump to transport water to the
          plants, we decided to use a submersible (sump) pump because it pumps
          more water at a faster rate than the peristaltic pumps. Instead, we
          used the peristaltic pump to transport the nutrient-rich solution from
          the nutrient bottle into the water basin. For waterproofing, we
          implemented rubber gaskets (o-rings) and rubber grommets. We used the
          rubber gaskets and gutter sealant to waterproof the connection between
          the hose barbs and the 3D printed gutter end caps. We used rubber
          grommets to waterproof the connection between the tubing and the vinyl
          gutter or the pvc pipe in which the water is diverted.
        </p>

        <p>
          The mechanical structure to support the electronic hardware was lower
          on the priorities for this sprint, and we used a piece of balsa wood
          to mount the breadboard and microcontroller. We mounted the power
          box/outlet at the bottom of the cart using the same exact 3D printed
          L-shaped hooks that we used in
          <a href="sprint1.html">Sprint I.</a> In an attempt to mount the LED
          grow lights in a simplistic manner, we laser cut strips of acrylic.
        </p>

        <p>
          For this sprint, we used zip ties to fasten the acrylic strips, the
          sump pump, the pvc pipe, and the balsa wood mount.

        <p>
          We used a basic Home Depot storage box to act as a water basin, and
          used a 3x4x12 feet vinyl gutter as the basis for our canal. We cut the
          gutter into 3 equal pieces, and set them up parallel to each other,
          before drilling 3 holes into each piece to later add seed containers.
          We then bought PVC tubing and endcaps, and watersealed the PVC tube
          before drilling small 3 inlet and 1 outlet holes, which we then fitted
          with grommets to ensure waterproofing. Next we fit tubing through the
          PVC, with inlet tubing connected to a larger sump pump inside our
          base, and outlet tubing being split among the 3 small outlet holes,
          which each flowed into one of the 3 canals. Finally each of the three
          canals has tubing which all connect to a central bracket, which
          ultimately leads back to the canal.

        <h5><b>Reasons for Design</b></h5>
        <p>
          As we mentioned above, our main principles for our final design were
          to be an inviting, convenient design that could grow multiple plants
          and fit in easily in any environment. We chose a cart to act as our
          frame because it is easy to move around and can be moved to wherever
          is most convenient, with an open top to act as a table so it can be
          used by the grower. Having multiple canals is one of the most material
          and space efficient ways to maximize plant growth, and having a
          central basin greatly simplifies re-adding nutrients.
        </p>

        <h3><b>Electrical Updates</b></h3>
        <p>
          For this sprint, we added 2 more actuators to our circuit. In addition
          to the water pump from <a href="sprint1.html">Sprint I,</a> there is
          now a nutrient pump and LED growth lights. We also added an
          illuminance sensor in addition to the temperature/humidity sensor we
          had before.
        </p>
        <p>The circuit schematic for this sprint is shown below.</p>

        <h3><b>Software Updates</b></h3>
        <p>
          The biggest software change from Sprint I is that there are now 3
          different actuators (water pump, nutrient pump, growing light) that
          runs on their own respective schedule. While both pumps still run on a
          simple millis() loop, the light uses actual time (ex. Turn on at 11:50
          AM, turn off at 1:00 PM) for scheduling.

        <h3><b>Sprint Reflection</b></h3>
        <p>
          The mechanical component's main goals were to be completely
          waterproofed, and have a working pump and water flow sufficient to
          grow plants. All of these goals were met, as well as integration of
          the electrical components into our design without compromising our
          design goals. However, electrical housing and pump attachment were
          ultimately not polished to the level we would like, while they were
          both functional, they did not meet our team's standard of aesthetics,
          nor the functionality of transporting the cart without damaging the
          components. We also did not consider the material safety for
          consumption, and resolved to do further analysis next sprint.
