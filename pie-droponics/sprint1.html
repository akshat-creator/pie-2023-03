        <h3><b>Sprint Overview</b></h3>
        <p>
          The goal of sprint 1 was to create a singular plant pot that uses an
          ESP32 microcontroller to automatically pump water and collect sensor
          data.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Mechanical</b></h3>
        <p>
          For our first sprint, we designed a simple single pod hydroponics
          system by which a pump moves water through our system. This design
          only has one pod, so our main goal for our next sprint was modularity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shown below is a rough sketch for the mechanical structure of sprint 1
        </p>

        <h5><b>Components</b></h5>
        <p>
          For the purpose of sprint 1, we wanted to focus on re-purposing and
          scrounging as many materials as possible, to recreate a fundamental
          hydroponic system as quickly as possible and to understand how we want
          to integrate future features and areas of challenge. Our first
          component is a repurposed trash can from Maricela's room, which acts
          as a water basin.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then laser cut a lid for the trash can from acrylic, with two holes
          in it. Next, we found a small sump pump to direct the flow of the
          water, and attached tubing to either end of it. We fed the tubing
          through a recycled plastic water bottle, with one hole being cut into
          its lid for a water exit, and another into the topwards-facing side of
          the plastic bottle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, we 3D-printed attachment mounts to hang over the trash can,
          and laser cut a flat piece to hang in between them. We then attached a
          simple breadboard with wires attached to the pump to control the flow
          of water.
        </p>
        <img style="width: 25%" src="images/sprint1/assembly.jpg" />
        <h5><b>Reasons for Design</b></h5>
        <p>
          We wanted to design in a way that optimized as little space and
          components as possible while still implementing mechanical and
          electrical components, in this case our pump and canal and the
          electrical breadboard which would send signals back to our computer.
          This design is easily fabricated, and had a lot of learnings that we
          used in future projects, like running a canal parallel to our basin
          (as opposed to a vertical farm) and designing safe, stable housing for
          electronics.
        </p>

        <h3><b>Software</b></h3>
        <p>
          For sprint 1, the software goal was to have a simple microcontroller
          code that turns the water pump on/off for a specified duration. This
          was achieved using the millis() function from the Arduino library. The
          user was able to change the duration by typing in the new duration in
          the Serial monitor. Also, the temperature & humidity readings from the
          sensor are displayed through the Serial monitor.

        <h3><b>Sprint Reflection</b></h3>
        <p>
          Our sprint 1 design functioned as we intended. There was absolutely no
          leaking, and water flowed both in and out of the basin. All the
          electrical compartments were stable, and could control the sump pump,
          as well as power the sensors. The sensors in turn sent temperature and
          humidity readings to our laptops, which we could read in real time.
