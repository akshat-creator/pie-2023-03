        <h3><b>Mechanical Update</b></h3>
        <p>
          After Sprint 3, we made no major functional changes to our final
          design. We reinforced some of the waterproofing, and used zip ties for
          cable management. The biggest change was adding a wooden tabletop to
          the top of our cart, such that it could function as furniture in a
          user's home.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we started wrapping up the project after our last Sprint, the
          main thing we wanted to polish before demo day was following our
          principle of pleasant aesthetics and being as easy to use as possible
          for our customers. To that end, while our PIE-droponic were both
          functional and compact, integration with a cart means it could be
          placed anywhere near a power outlet. However, one idea we were really
          passionate about is that the PIE-droponic wouldn't stand out wherever
          it is placed, and would be able to function as a piece of furniture as
          well as being able to grow plants. To that end, we designed a logo for
          our project. Our branding has mostly stayed consistent in our project,
          and we all thought a wooden engraving would be so much more visually
          appealing then a plain wooden top. Our design was based upon our logo:
        </p>
        <img style="width: 30%" src="images/final/logo.png" />
        <p>
          So after we designed a new logo on illustrator, we laser cut a shallow
          cut into ½’ by 2''' by 2''' plywood, which was then bandsaw down to
          exactly our cart's dimensions. We next sanded down all the edges to
          make sure the wood was easy to handle and grab onto. Finally, we used
          a finish in the LPB composites bay to ensure the wood's safety, as
          well as giving it a final level of professionalism.

        <h3><b>Electrical Update</b></h3>
        <p>
          The electrical components stayed the same from
          <a href="sprint3.html#circuit-diagram">Sprint III</a>.
        </p>

        <h3><b>Software Update</b></h3>
        <p>
          Most of the software improvments from Sprint III involved improving
          the UI of the React App. The functionality stayed the same, but we
          gave the website an aesthetic improvement.

        <h3><b>Finishing Thoughts</b></h3>
        <p>
          This project's been a super great learning on how I can use a lot of
          my mechanical skills to explore different project areas. Once we
          decided on hydroponics for our project, it became so much fun to do
          research on different materials, learn how we can fabricate in house,
          and see our project assembled step by step. I really hope I can
          continue to use my previously learned skills to continue to discover
          new application sectors at Olin, and have the same open-mindedness for
          growth and love for learning to become as passionate as I am with
          PIE-dro. - Satchel
